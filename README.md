### Workflow

### Techniques

1. How to parse XML file
* The app need to parse these xml files to get metadata
Use SAX parser to catch tags to read metadata
* SAX vs DOM
	* DOM: load the entire DOM tree into memory. Can 
travel through DOM tree.
	* SAX: Event-based XML processing, read XML file in stream, small part.
Donâ€™t have to load and hold the whole data in memory. Thus it is lightweight.
Get data by listening for events when SAX hits XML tags.

* When to use SAX
 	* When documents are large
With SAX, memory consumption does not increase with the size of file.
40Mb doc occupy 200Mb in memory using SAX but 3Gb  with DOM
	* Need to abort parsing
Can abort processing at anytime
Only need to fetch a small part of doc, not the whole

2. How to display epub content
* Book content in Epub is HTML or XHTML
* Can use WebView to display them
* But WebView supports vertical scrolling in default
* Need to customize a WebView that support page-liked swiping. Also need to support customizing font size, text color, background color <br>
=> We inject JS function and CSS to support the requirements above
